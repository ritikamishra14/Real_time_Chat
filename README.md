# Real_time_Chat
A simple real time chat application made using Django Channels. 
Channels augments Django to bring WebSocket, long-poll HTTP, task offloading and other async support to code, using familiar Django design patterns and a flexible underlying framework that lets not only customize behaviours but also write support for own protocols and needs.
